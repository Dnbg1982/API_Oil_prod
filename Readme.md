# Oil Decay Production APP
(Reach the application here.) (https://dnbg1982-api-oil-prod-prodapi-iphald.streamlitapp.com/)
Nowadays Data Scientists not only can clean data and make models but also build data apps using tools such as streamlit. I used this library to show how Machine Learning may predict oil production of different wells based on basic features such us basin and formation. 

GOAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simplify how final users interact with oil data through an app.

DATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Datasets used are the same in Kaggle Competition about Oil Production. Data was transformed as same for modeling using XGBoost.
